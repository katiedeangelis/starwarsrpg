# Star Wars (RPG)

A Star Wars based role playing game.

## How the app works:
- When the game starts, the player is able to choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture (the player will fight as that character for the rest of the game).
- The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters (these fighters are now enemies that are moved to a different area of the screen).
- The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.
- Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a defender area.

## Functionality:

Once the player selects his/her character and the enemy the player is able to:

- Click the attack button.
- Attacks cause damage to the enemy (loss of health points which are displayed under defender's picture).
- Enemy automatically counter-attacks.
- Counter-attacks cause damage to the players character (loss of health points displayed under player's picture).
- The player is able to keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.
- When the enemy's HP is reduced to zero or below, is defeated and removed from the defender area.
- The player character can now choose a new opponent.


## Goal:

The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. 

The player loses the game the game if their character's HP falls to zero or below.

## Additional Features:

- Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. 

## Strategy:
A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low Counter Attack Power. This will allow them to grind Attack Power and to take on enemies before they lose all of their Health Points.

Players are able to win and lose the game no matter what character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.
